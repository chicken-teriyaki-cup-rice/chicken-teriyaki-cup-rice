### :wave: Aloha! Automate All The Things!

Iâ€™m interested in resilience engineering, observability, human factors and everything in between. In my spare time, I learn new technologies and contribute to open-source projects.

All the projects I'm currently working on are not meant to discover what is the most canonical answer is but rather to figure out what questions we don't have answers to and which assumptions we thought were correct might not be. 

I'm also open to job opportunities, feel free to check my CV.
