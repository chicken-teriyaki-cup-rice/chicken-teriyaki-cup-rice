# FOSS Automate All The Things!

**Aloha!**

I build things that keep working when things go sideways.

I care about resilience engineering, observability, and human factors.  
I treat failure as normal, so I add layers, detect drift early, recover fast, then tighten the system.  
I don’t chase a single “root cause” - I fix the chain and write down what changed.

**Influences:** Richard I. Cook - [*How Complex Systems Fail*](https://how.complexsystems.fail/).
