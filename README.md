### :wave: Aloha! Automate All The Things!

Iâ€™m a backend developer interested in resilience, observability, human factors and everything around it. In my spare time, I learn new technologies and contribute to open-source projects.

All the things I'm currently working on are available in my repositories. Feel free to contribute to my repositories no matter how small the change is - even typo fixes are welcome!

I'm also open to job opportunities, feel free to check my CV.
